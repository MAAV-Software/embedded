Eigen and CMath implementation of CMSIS DSPLib's matrix math (and other things).

Reimplements the 32-bit floating point matrix math from the set of functions found 
in arm_math.h. When using Linux, include cmeigen.hpp rather than arm_math.hpp.

Dependency: Eigen (version 3) needs to be installed. CMake will find it for you.
