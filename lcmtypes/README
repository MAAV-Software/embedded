LCM(-Lite) for MAAV Controls
----------------------------

This directory contains the LCM message specifiers and auto-generated code for 
handling the messaging system of LCM. Two versions of the auto-generated code 
exist in the following:

1) gen-lite

	This directory contains lcm-generated code for each message in the "lite" 
	format (i.e. generated with "lcm-gen <msg>.lcm --c --c-no-pubsub").
	
2) gen-lite-typeinfo

	This directory contains lcm-generated code for each message in the "lite"
	format with typeinfo functions (i.e. generated with 
	"lcm-gen <msg>.lcm --c --c-no-pubsub --c-typeinfo").

All code is generated in the format of "lcm-lite" (which is the lcm code in C 
without publish and subscribe functions) which allows it to be used in embedded 
systems.

Each message is specifiec in its respective "<msg>.lcm" file like a struct. The 
data fields of each message take on LCM's primitive types (see LCM documentation 
for more info on type specifications).

Here's an overview of each message and it's purpose:
