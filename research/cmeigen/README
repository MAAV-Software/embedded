CMEIGEN
-------

By Sasawat

Eigen and CMath implementation of CMSIS DSPLib's matrix math (and other things).

Reimplements the 32-bit floating point matrix math from the set of functions found 
in arm_math.h. When using Linux, include cmeigen.hpp rather than arm_math.hpp.

Dependency: Eigen (version 3) needs to be installed. Change the path in the Makefile
to reflect where the headers are installed on your machine.

All you need to do after is make this and link the object file to your project.
